        "The Air Polis application provides real time information about air quality in the center of Thessaloniki, Greece. The air quality data are collected from measurement station hosted at the Faculty of Engineering at the Aristotle University Campus (AUTh) and are evaluated, as a pilot case study, by the innovative monitoring system of Air Pollution Intelligent Defense (AID). AID is an intelligent multi-agent monitoring network with main target to assess air quality and environmental conditions in real time and support decision making and action implementation for public health protection and air pollution mitigation.\n\nIn 2017, AID was recognized as an innovative air quality monitoring tool by winning the 5th award in the 7th Innovation and Technology National Competition of the National Bank of Greece (NBG Business Seeds). \n\nImportant note: The application is available in pilot scale to all citizens and visitors of Thessaloniki for free. The air quality data include main air pollutants, such as O3, NO2, SO2, CO and PM10 and air temperature and relative humidity. Additional services are the real-time calculation of European Air Quality Index and the seasonal evaluation of the Heat Index during summer. AUTh is not responsible for the accuracy or any other characteristics of the data. The provided air quality information serves research purposes only. Since the measurement station has not been subjected to a quality assurance review to determine its accuracy, the data and the results presented cannot be used for other applications.. \n\nFor further information about AID and Air Polis application, \n- please visit our official website http://aid.karteco.gr/en/index or\n- contact us by email: m.karteris@karteco.gr",

      description:
        'Developed in partnership with former KCCI-TV (Des Moines, IA) meteorologist John McLaughlin to provide a simplified display of advanced radar data and Safety Net Alerting to multiple locations with user-definable thresholds. McLaughlin pioneered the use of Doppler radar for severe storm tracking on Iowa television, working with Bob Baron of Baron Weather to develop and install the nation\'s first High Definition Doppler radar (VHDD) in 1995. Storm Hunter allows you the option to select notification as storms begin to produce lighting, hail, or rotation so you can be alerted even before official warnings are issued. Up to eight locations can be specified so you can make sure your loved ones know when dangerous weather approaches.\n\nStorm Hunter includes five high resolution NWS radars covering Iowa. Select from radar intensity and velocity, plus one click threat delineation with the "Baron Button" breaking down storm cells into rain, hail and wind threats. \n\nStorm Hunter\'s Future Scan product extrapolates storm cells from their current radar locations out to one hour including predicted decay or growth.\n\nDetailed national radar will cover you across the United States, plus our "U.S. Severe Wind" product shows the areas of greatest wind shear as detected across the network of National Weather Service Doppler Radars. This tool is useful for quickly identifying rotation and damaging wind areas.\n\nIn addition to custom alerts, you can save multiple location for specific computer generated weather forecasts from the national weather prediction models. Forecast radar and rain/snow accumulations out to 24 hours and radar estimated rain totals are great features in the Storm Hunter app.\n\nThe Storm Hunter app is linked to the Iowa Storm Chasing Network for live streaming of severe weather events from the Storm Hunter Ford Escape chase vehicle and live radar analysis for significant tornado days.\n\nStorm Hunter Weather is sponsored by the McLaughlin Family companies in Iowa, Including New Way Ford, New Way Auto Group, McLaughlin Imprint and Apparel and Hurricane Motorsports. Advertisement links include exclusive discounts on new and used automobiles and apparel for Storm Hunter users.\n\nMeteorologist John McLaughlin says "The Storm Hunter app is a way for me to continue to share my passion for weather, even after my 31 year career on Iowa television ended due to a medical condition. Best of all, thanks to my family members financial support, the app is free to download and use. For that I am very grateful."',

        'Ever needed to know what the current wind speed and direction is where you are at? \nWant to know how windy it is outside without having to run out there and throw some grass in the air?\nNow you can with the Wind Compass!\n\nWind Compass gets your current location and then the current weather conditions based on that location. No fuss, no configuration, just quick weather readouts.\n\nCurrent options include the ability to switch Wind Speed reading between Miles/hour or Kilometers/hour or Knots or Beaufort Wind Force or Meters Per Second\nSelect Compass north from True North or Magnetic North\nSelect Temperature from Fahrenheit or Celsius\nSelect the Arrow direction of the Wind Indicator from Blowing To or Coming From\n\nAlong with your wind info, Wind Compass also displays:\nCurrent Temperature as well as the Estimated Highs and Lows for that day.\nSunrise/Sunset times as well as the estimated "First Light" and "Last light" times for that day (Also known as Nautical Twilight Start and End)\n24 Hour Forecast as well as 7 Day Forecast giving you a weather timeline for the Time, Estimated Temperature, Estimated Wind Speed and Direction and % Chance of precipitation by the hour or day.\n\nYou can also change the look of the app by selecting from the many different background types including standard colored backgrounds.\n\nWind Compass uses the Darksky.net Weather data to provide accurate conditions where you are. Just open the app, let it update, and there you go. Darksky uses many sources and creates as accurate of a forecast as possible for your location.\n\nAs an added bonus, Wind Compass shows you which way is North so if you are inside or turned around, you can always know which way is north, along with the current wind direction.\n\nIf you have any issues with Wind Compass please email anapa.apps@gmail.com to quickly get the issue resolved.You can also submit a feature request or bug report right from inside the settings area!\n\n*NOTE* Compass functionality within the app requires physical compass functionality built in.\n\n*NOTE* Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n*NOTE* Storage/Media/Files access is required for saving the share image and for data cacheing with normal usage of the app. \n\n*NOTE* Location access is required to get your current location to get the weather info.\n\nCredits\n\nForecast Information provided by Darksky.net',
